Git & GitHub - Summary for Beginners
This is a summary of the key concepts you learned today about Git and GitHub.

1. Setting Up:

Git Installation: Install Git on your system. You can find download links and instructions on the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/).
Code Editor: Choose a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for working with your code. 2. Git Basics:

Terminology:
Repository (repo): A collection of files and their revision history.
Commit: A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time.
Branch: A separate line of development for your code.
Staging Area: Temporary storage for files before committing.
Basic Commands:
git init: Creates a new Git repository.
git clone: Downloads an existing repository from a remote location like GitHub.
git status: Shows the current status of your working directory.
git add: Adds files to the staging area.
git commit: Creates a commit with a descriptive message.
git push: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository (GitHub). 3. Working with GitHub:

Publishing Local Repo:
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Use git init, git remote add, and git push commands to connect your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. 4. Git Workflow:

Branching:
git branch: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
main branch: The main codebase of your project.
feature branch: Used to develop new features without affecting the main branch.
hotfix branch: Used to fix critical bugs quickly.
Workflow:
Create a feature or hotfix branch from the main branch.
Make your changes and commit them regularly.
Use git diff to see the changes between branches.
After completing your work, create a pull request on GitHub to propose merging your branch into the main branch.
Collaborate on the pull request with reviewers before merging.
Once merged, delete the feature branch (if no longer needed). 5. Advanced Topics:

Pull Requests:
Write clear and descriptive titles and comments while creating a pull request.
Merge Conflicts:
Learn how to resolve merge conflicts that arise when merging branches.
Undoing Changes:
Understand how to unstage files, undo commits, and use hard reset (with caution!).
Forking:
Learn how to fork a repository on GitHub to contribute to open-source projects.
Remember: This is a basic summary. There's always more to learn about Git and GitHub. Refer to the official documentation and tutorials for in-depth explanations and practice:
